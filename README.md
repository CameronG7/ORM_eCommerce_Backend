# ORM_eCommerce_Backend
  

## Description

![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue )

In this project I have developed the code for a server-based app that allows the user with interact with an eCommerce database via PostMan or Insomnia.
This was accomplished by using sql queries using that are generated using the Sequelize package.  
This project was a good way to further develop my skills in the backend on my way to becoming a fullstack developer. 
The app also serves the functional purpose of being something very similar to the sklls I would need to help my current job develop a parts database.

Once installed, create a file called ```.env``` in the projects main directory. In this file, create DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD and use the database name provided in the schema.sql file 
and your mySQL login info as the other two fields. Then use the schema.sql code and a SQL interface of your choice to create the database.  
In the terminal run ```npm i```. This will install any dependancies needed. Then run  ```node seeds/``` to seed the default data to the database. Now run ```npm start``` and the app is ready to go!
Open postman or insomnia to make api requests and see magic.

## Credits
